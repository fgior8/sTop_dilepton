Class Usage:

 - BTagSFUtil *BTagSF = new BTagSFUtil(BTagAlgorithm, OperatingPoint, SystematicIndex);
   
      Where: BTagAlgorithm is the btag algorithm you want to use, ex: "CSV"
             OperatingPoint can be "Loose", "Medium" or "Tight"
             SystematicIndex +1 (-1) to scale up (down) the b-jets SF according to they total uncertainty
                             +3 (-3) to scale up (down) the light-jets SF according to they total uncertainty
                             Remember that these two uncertainties have to be treated as independet!

 - When running over FastSim MC, the dataset has to be specified to retrive special correction factors:
  
      BTagSFUtil *BTagSF = new BTagSFUtil(BTagAlgorithm, OperatingPoint, SystematicIndex, FastSimDataset);
 
         Where the supported FastSim datasets for 8 TeV are T1bbbb, T1tttt, T2, T2bb, T2bwm T2tt and T3w
         SystematicIndex for FastSim SFs follow the same code as above +/-10 
	     e.g. to scale down the FastSim SF for light-jets by its uncertainty, set SystematicIndex to -13
             Note that for FastSim indepenent SFs for c-jets are used, with SystematicIndex +/-12
             Important: FastSim SF uncertainties should be treated as independet from standard SF ones
   
 - To get the SF for a given jet:

      GetJetSF->IsTagged(JetFlavor, JetPt, JetEta);

 - For applying the SF to a jet according to the "flip a coin" method:

      BTagSF->IsTagged(DiscriminatorValue, JetFlavor, JetPt, JetEta);

         Where: DiscriminatorValue is the value for the discriminant of your choise for the jet to which the SF has being applied
